\subsection{Google and YouTube's Data Collection on Children}\label{subsec:google-and-youtube's-data-collection-on-children}
In 2019, Google and YouTube were fined \$170 million by the FTC for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). They had collected personal information from children under 13 without parental consent, raising significant privacy concerns and violating ethical principles of informed consent.
This case highlights the vulnerability of children in the digital age and the need for stricter regulations to protect their privacy.

The ethical implications of this case are profound.
Children, as a vulnerable population, require special protections.
Collecting data without parental consent not only violates legal standards but also ethical norms of safeguarding minors.
The lack of transparency and informed consent in this case undermines trust in digital platforms and calls for more robust regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical data practices.

\subsection{Google+ Data Breach}\label{subsec:google+-data-breach}
In 2018, Google announced that a software glitch in Google+ had exposed private data of up to 500,000 users.
The breach, discovered in March 2018, was not disclosed immediately, raising issues of transparency and accountability.
The delayed disclosure prevented users from taking timely actions to protect their data, leading to potential harm and distrust.

The Google+ data breach underscores the importance of timely disclosure in maintaining trust and accountability.
From an ethical standpoint, withholding information about data breaches violates the principle of transparency and the duty to protect users' privacy.
The incident also highlights the need for better security measures and proactive communication strategies to manage data breaches effectively.

\subsection{Project Nightingale}\label{subsec:project-nightingale}
In 2019, it was revealed that Google had partnered with Ascension to collect and analyze health data of millions of Americans without informing them.
This project raised significant privacy concerns and issues related to informed consent.
The use of sensitive health data without explicit consent undermines trust in healthcare providers and digital services.

The ethical concerns surrounding Project Nightingale revolve around the unauthorized use of sensitive health information.
Health data is inherently personal and requires stringent protections.
The lack of informed consent and transparency in this case breaches ethical standards and poses risks to patient privacy and autonomy.
This case illustrates the need for ethical guidelines and regulations in handling health data.

\subsection{Google’s Location Tracking}\label{subsec:googles-location-tracking}
In 2018, an investigation by the Associated Press found that Google continued to track users' location even when they had turned off location tracking settings, which was seen as deceptive and a violation of privacy.
This practice highlights the discrepancy between user expectations and actual data practices, leading to ethical concerns about honesty and transparency.

Google's location tracking practices raise ethical questions about deception and respect for user preferences.
Despite user actions to disable location tracking, continued data collection violates privacy and autonomy.
This case emphasizes the importance of aligning data practices with user expectations and ensuring that privacy controls are effective and respected.

\subsection{Google Street View Wi-Fi Data Collection}\label{subsec:google-street-view-wi-fi-data-collection}
Between 2007 and 2010, Google Street View cars inadvertently collected data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, including personal emails and passwords.
This incident highlighted unauthorized data collection and lack of transparency.
The inadvertent nature of the data collection does not absolve Google of responsibility, as it indicates inadequate safeguards and oversight.

The ethical issues in this case involve unauthorized data collection and the lack of transparency in Google's actions.
Collecting personal data without consent breaches privacy and trust.
The incident underscores the need for robust data governance practices and transparent communication with users about data collection activities.

\subsection{Incognito Mode Tracking Lawsuit}\label{subsec:incognito-mode-tracking-lawsuit}
In 2020, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Google for allegedly continuing to track users' internet activity even in Incognito mode, designed for private browsing.
This raised significant ethical concerns about privacy and deception.
The promise of privacy in Incognito mode is contradicted by the continued tracking, undermining user trust and autonomy.

The ethical implications of tracking users in Incognito mode are significant.
Promising privacy and then violating it not only undermines user trust but also breaches the ethical principles of honesty and respect for user autonomy.
Users rely on Incognito mode for private browsing, and violating this expectation of privacy is a serious ethical breach.
