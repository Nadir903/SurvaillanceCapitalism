Surveillance capitalism presents a complex interplay of benefits and ethical challenges.
While it has led to significant advancements in personalized services, economic growth, efficient advertisement and technological innovation, it also has shown to threat ethical values as privacy, autonomy, and democratic practices.

The analysis through various ethical lenses as deontological contractualism, consequentialism, and hedonism reveals that the main issues of surveillance capitalism revolve around the lack of transparency, informed consent, fair conditions and the potential misuse of personal data.
For contractualist ethics, the unfair agreements, lack of true mutual consent between users and companies and violation of individual rights to privacy and autonomy are condemned neglect practices.
Consequentialism raises concerns about the negative impacts on the society, such as growing distrust and increasing anxiety.
Finally, hedonism points to the total pain caused by constant surveillance outweighing the pleasure of personalized and targeted services.

But the implications of surveillance capitalism even extend beyond individual privacy concerns.
The huge accumulation of data in the hands of few corporations gives them unprecedented power to influence public opinion and behavior, which endanger democratic processes, as seen in cases of data misuse for political advertising.
Moreover, the obscure nature of data gathering practices tears down public trust in digital platforms.
And it additionally reuses concern about the ethical use of technology.

Therefore, a multi-faceted approach is needed to address these challenge:

Regulatory Supervision: Governments must implement and enforce strict data ownership protection laws that require companies to be transparent about their data collection practices, what they do with that data and explicit ask for consent from users.
Regulations as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union should play a role as precedent, but more inclusive and globally consistent structures for this regulation are needed.

Corporate Responsibility: Tech companies must follow ethical data collection practices as part of their social responsibility.
This includes minimizing data collection following a need-to-know approach.
Ensuring data security for preventing data leaks and being transparent about data use are key for user trust.
Companies should also provide users clear and accessible tools to monitor and control, how much of their data is being collected.

High-tech Solutions: Innovation should aim the development of tools and technologies that enhance privacy and security.
Techniques and procedures as differential privacy, encryption, and secure multi-party computation can help the security and integrity of user data while still enabling valuable insights.

Future research should focus on developing ethical frameworks and practical solutions for balancing the benefits of data-driven innovation and the right of individual for privacy and transparency.
This includes exploring new models of data ownership, where users can have a much better control over their data and can choose whether to monetize it themselves or just avoid its collection.
In conclusion, while the business model of surveillance capitalism has pushed the development of significant technological and economic advancements, it comes with keen ethical challenges and issues that must be addressed to ensure a fair digital society.
By fostering a culture of ethical data collection practices, enhancing regulatory oversight, and giving users power over their own data, we can create a digital ecosystem that respects individual rights and enhances trust.
